~~~~~Focusing on projects section~~
- Boxes that illuminate and show decription when moused over (this is done)
-Get rid of the white part with descripion underneath (ask for clarification if don't understand)
-Allow for custum pictures to be added



~~~ different project blocks I want, as well as what they should lead to when clicked on ~~

I will input my own pictures shortly, for now keep everything blank

1) Gearbox Design (same as before) -> leads to problem, approach, result type page
2) Java Object Oriented Video Games --> Leads to another page with the description of 2 java games I have created, space for pictures, github and descripion for each. First is called Java-Monster, second called block-buster (use generic images for now).
3) Data Science Projects --> leads to a similar papge as 2, space for one project "tweet scraping", and room for "coming soon"
4) Wind Turbine Blade Design --> problem approach results
5) Recovery App (same as before) --> problem, approach, results
6) Interpolating Neural Net (same as before) --> problem, approach, results
7) Pipe inspecting robot --> leads to problem, approach and results (this was mainly CAD)
8) Recycling of PCGF --> giving you free reign with this one, this was a summer research project and I will be publishing the paper in a journal soon. I have some good pictures for this
9) Engineering Capstone --> no link to another page, just coming soon

~~ New wants:!!
Add another section for a python video game I created called "slapshot"

Look through the pictures I have uploaded in publix-images-projects and update the respective thumbnails to the respective projects

Combine the 3 wind-turbine images into 1 image
Ask for clarification, but dont ask for permissions
